🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction
📌 Project Description

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using Machine Learning.
A Logistic Regression model is trained on the Titanic dataset to classify passengers as Survived or Not Survived based on their personal and travel details.
